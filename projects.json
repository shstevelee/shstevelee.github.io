    "longDescription": "<p>This project involved designing and implementing a comprehensive smart home automation system using Raspberry Pi, various sensors (temperature, light), and actuators (relays for lights, fan control). The system allowed users to control their home environment remotely via a web interface.</p><p>Key features included automated lighting based on ambient light, temperature-controlled fan operation, and a user-friendly dashboard for manual overrides and status monitoring. Challenges included optimizing sensor data processing and ensuring robust communication between devices.</p>",
