    "longDescription": "<p>I began building this website using Bootstrap to quickly prototype the layout and styling. However, I soon switched back to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to gain more control over the structure and behavior of the site. Eventually, I decided to do a full redesign using the Vue.js CDN for a more dynamic and component-based approach. Along the way, I reorganized the project's file structure to better separate concerns and improve scalability, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.</p>",
