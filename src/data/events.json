Our team developed an AI-powered parser for lab safety documentation, designed to help researchers quickly extract and reference critical information—such as handling procedures, spill response, and injury treatment—for chemicals used in the lab. We envisioned scaling the tool to cover a wider range of lab materials, including measurement devices and electrical components in ECE labs, as well as biological agents in life science labs. We also proposed integrating the system with AI voice assistants, enabling researchers in emergency situations to call out for help instead of scrambling through documentation.</p>",
