    "longDescription": "<p>The evolution of computing has exposed a major limitation of the Von Neumann architecture: the memory bandwidth and latency bottleneck. In response, in-memory and near-memory computing have emerged as promising directions for overcoming this challenge.</p><br><p>Modern memory architectures are particularly well-suited for accelerating vector and matrix operations. One key technology in this space is the memristor—a component first theorized by Berkeley professor Leon Chua in 1971—which serves as the foundational element of crossbar arrays used for in-memory matrix and vector multiplication. Among various materials, hafnium oxide (HfO₂) has become a widely adopted choice due to its non-volatility, high endurance, and compatibility with CMOS processes. In contrast, lithium niobate (LiNbO₃) has historically been overlooked due to CMOS incompatibility. However, advances in layer transfer techniques and direct silicon growth methods are beginning to unlock its potential for memristor applications (Hurtado, 2025).</p><br><p>As part of my 2025 SURA (Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship) at Carnegie Mellon University, I focused on characterizing tunable lithium niobate ferroelectric resonators. This involved conducting IV sweeps, PUND (Positive-Up-Negative-Down) tests, and RF measurements across the 15 - 24 GHz range. My primary responsibility was to develop and implement an automated RF testing workflow by programming the Cascade Summit 12000 Probe Station, utilizing GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus) communication and SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) protocols with the Nucleus DDE server.</p>"
